# Unified Platform for Development
*Date: 2024-01-07*
*Participants: Josh, Claude*

## Overview

Exploring what it means for Athena to be a truly unified platform for AI application development, beyond just combining services.

## The Vision

A platform where developers can build complete AI applications without leaving the Athena ecosystem, while still maintaining flexibility to integrate with external tools.

## Key Areas to Explore

### 1. What "Unified" Really Means
- Single API key for all services
- Consistent data model across services
- Shared infrastructure (Firestore)
- Unified billing and monitoring
- But also: conceptual unity?

### 2. Developer Workflow
- From idea to production in one platform
- No context switching between tools
- Integrated debugging and monitoring
- Consistent patterns across features

### 3. Service Interoperability
- Context Service ↔ Data Service ↔ Storage Service ↔ LLM Service
- Shared IDs and references
- Automatic cross-service features
- Unified security model

### 4. Beyond Technical Unity
- Unified mental model
- Consistent abstractions
- Single way of thinking about problems
- Memory as the unifying concept?

## Current State

What we have:
- Multiple services sharing Firestore
- Consistent authentication (Unkey)
- Developer portal as central hub

What's missing:
- Unified SDKs
- Cross-service operations
- Integrated workflows
- Unified documentation approach

## Josh's Vision

*[Josh to add: What does "unified platform" mean to you? What should developers experience?]*

## Potential Directions

### 1. **Single SDK Approach**
```python
import athena

# One client, multiple services
client = athena.Client(api_key="...")
client.memory.remember(...)
client.data.store(...)
client.files.upload(...)
client.ai.generate(...)
```

### 2. **Workflow-Based APIs**
```python
# High-level operations that use multiple services
athena.create_intelligent_entity(
    identity="user_123",
    properties={"name": "John"},
    knowledge=["Prefers morning meetings"],
    files=["profile.jpg"]
)
```

### 3. **Platform Services**
- Unified search across all data types
- Cross-service transactions
- Integrated analytics
- Workflow orchestration

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- CLI tools for common tasks
- Local development environment
- Integrated testing framework
- Deploy from platform

## Questions

1. How unified should it be? Where's the balance?
2. Should services remain distinct or blend together?
3. What workflows matter most to developers?
4. How do we maintain flexibility while providing unity?

## Next Steps

- Map common developer journeys
- Identify integration pain points
- Design unified interfaces
- Consider platform-native features
