# Memory and Knowledge Graphs
*Date: 2024-01-07*
*Participants: Josh, Claude*

## Overview

Exploring the deep connection between memory systems and knowledge graphs in Athena, and how they work together to create intelligent applications.

## Current Understanding

In Athena:
- **Contexts** form nodes in the knowledge graph (User, Project, Task)
- **Relationships** form edges (parent-child hierarchies, associations)
- **Understandings** add semantic meaning to nodes
- **Metadata** (via Data Service) adds properties to nodes

## Key Questions to Explore

### 1. Knowledge Graph as Memory Structure
- How does a knowledge graph differ from traditional memory storage?
- What makes knowledge graphs ideal for AI memory?
- How do we balance structure vs flexibility?

### 2. Memory Operations on Graphs
- **Remember**: Adding nodes and edges
- **Recall**: Traversing the graph based on context
- **Forget**: Pruning or archiving parts of the graph
- **Learn**: Strengthening frequently accessed paths

### 3. Practical Implications
- How does this help developers build better apps?
- What patterns emerge from this approach?
- How do we make graph concepts accessible?

## Josh's Initial Thoughts

*[Josh to add: What aspects of memory + knowledge graphs are most important to explore?]*

## Potential Topics

1. **Graph Traversal for Context**
   - Starting from a user node, gather all relevant context
   - Follow edges based on relevance/recency
   - Build context windows dynamically

2. **Memory Hierarchies**
   - Short-term: Recent contexts/understandings
   - Long-term: Established relationships and patterns
   - Episodic: Session-based groupings

3. **Semantic Networks**
   - How understandings create semantic layers
   - Vector embeddings as weighted edges
   - Similarity as proximity in the graph

4. **Temporal Aspects**
   - How memory changes over time
   - Graph evolution and versioning
   - Memory decay and reinforcement

## Next Steps

- Define concrete use cases
- Explore visualization possibilities
- Consider API implications
